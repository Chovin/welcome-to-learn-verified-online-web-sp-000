# Welcome

Welcome to the Learn-Verified Full Stack Web Development track. Over the next 800-1000 hours you will learn everything you need to know to get started as a Full Stack Web Developer. Before you get started, just a few thoughts about how our curriculum is laid out.

## The Learn IDE

When you first start learning to code the amount of setup you have to do to get your computer ready to really *make* something can be frustrating. To counter this, we created the Learn IDE. If you haven't already, you should [download the Learn IDE now](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/how-to-download-and-use-learn-ide-3). The Learn IDE uses a popular programmers text editor (Atom) and also provides you with a terminal window for running commands, just as you would as a professional developer. However, instead of having to configure your local computer to allow you to program, it runs your commands on a remote computer so you can start right away with programming - not configuring of your computer. Bear in mind, using the IDE does mean you will have to be connected to the Internet while you program, but it's a much easier way to get started.

Once you've completed your first portfolio project review, you can then look into setting up a [local environment](http://help.learn.co/workflow-tips/local-environment/installing-a-supported-local-environment). There are lots of ways of getting your computer set up for programming (especially if you have a Mac or run a version of Linux as your operating system), but the way above (using a "Virtual Machine" - a separate computer within your computer) is the only one we can provide support for. If you have any more questions about when to move from the IDE to a local environment, [this article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/the-basics-of-the-learn-ide/using-the-ide-versus-a-local-environment) should help!


It's going to be harder, and more rewarding than any other learning experience you've ever had, we promise. Let's learn together.
